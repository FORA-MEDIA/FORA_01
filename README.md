# FORA_01

FORA is an intra-organizational consortium developing crucial cultural infrastructure with decentralized methodologies.

The virtual convening invites interdisciplinary specialists – conservators, curators, appraisers, engineers, creative technologists, researchers, critics, and collectors – to engage in a virtual peer-review process aimed at boosting conservation and care practices for experimental media art. 

Each FORA event convenes alongside an exhibition of media artwork that has been restored or preventively conserved with decentralized methods. The inaugural convening features a case study from TRANSFER presenting LaTurbo Avedon’s exhibition 'New Sculpt'(2013), produced at Onassis ONX Studio in NYC on Friday, October 27th 2023.

FORA aspires to address a range of challenges the media art world faces, including:
- Loss Prevention: Examining how innovations in decentralized storage can aid in long term access to invaluable media art history.
- Knowledge Dissemination: Exploring ways to make the expertise of conservators and other professionals in museological practices accessible to a broader community.
- Transparency in Appraisal: Shining a light on the opaque practices involved in the appraisal and pricing of media art.
- Value Exchange: Investigating decentralized networks that can create more equitable value exchange systems for artists.
