# FORA_01

FORA is an intra-organizational consortium focused on conservation and regenerative cultural infrastructure built on decentralized technology. This initiative convenes expert conservators, curators, engineers, appraisers, and collectors to engage in an open peer-review process aimed at boosting the conservation and care methods for media art. 

Each FORA event focuses on an exhibition of media artworks that have been restored or preventively conserved with decentralized methods. The inaugural convening features LaTurbo Avedonâ€™s exhibition 'New Sculpt'(2013) and will be hosted at Onassis ONX Studio in NYC on Friday, October 27th 2023.

FORA aspires to address a range of challenges the media art world faces, including:
- Loss Prevention: Examining how innovations in decentralized storage can aid in long term access to invaluable media art history.
- Knowledge Dissemination: Exploring ways to make the expertise of conservators and other professionals in museological practices accessible to a broader community.
- Transparency in Appraisal: Shining a light on the opaque practices involved in the appraisal and pricing of media art.
- Value Exchange: Investigating decentralized networks that can create more equitable value exchange systems for artists.
