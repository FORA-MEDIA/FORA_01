# FORA_01
Inaugural Convening of FORA

FORA is an intra-organizational consortium focused on conservation and regenerative cultural infrastructure built on decentralized technology. This initiative convenes expert conservators, curators, engineers, appraisers, and collectors to engage in an open peer-review process aimed at boosting the conservation and care methods for media art. FORA aspires to address a range of challenges the media art world faces, including:
- Loss Prevention: Examining how innovations in decentralized storage can aid in long term access to invaluable media art history.
- Knowledge Dissemination: Exploring ways to make the expertise of conservators and other professionals in museological practices accessible to a broader community.
- Transparency in Appraisal: Shining a light on the opaque practices involved in the appraisal and pricing of media art.
- Value Exchange: Investigating decentralized networks that can create more equitable value exchange systems for artists.
